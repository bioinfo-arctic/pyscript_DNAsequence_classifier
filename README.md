# Pyscript DNA sequence classifier
Implementation of a DNA classifier using pyscript and HTML, to have a classification engine running at the user side without the burdens of a backend infrastructure.

The first test will be based on the implementation of the Hamming distance, but ultimately we want to implement the [RDP classifier](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1950982/).
